My name is Alex, and this is a blog about things I happen to work with. Mainly it's developing iOS apps and frameworks, UX and UI design, data mining and machine learning.

## Who am I?

<img src="{{ base_path }}/images/about-photo.jpg" alt="" class="image-left" style="width: 140px;" hspace="10" align="left"> I am a full-stack software engineer with commercial experience dating back to 2008, currently concentrating primarily with **iOS development** and **data science**. I used to work in telecom, banking, media, hospitality, travel, healthcare, gambling and have done multiple projects related to information security. Keen on astrophysics, music and good design.
